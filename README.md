How to play Lacuna:  
  Lacuna is an abstract strategy game for two players. You will complete to collect 49 planets randomly placed on a circular board.  
  There are seven planets in seven colors.  
  The first player collects one random planet as compensation for going first.  
  The players take turns placing pawns on the board, pawns must be placed on an uninterrupted line that connects two planets of the same color. When the pawn is placed, the player collects the two connected planets.  
  After each player has placed four pawns, the remaining planets are collected by the player who has a pawn closest to the planet.  
  When a player collects four planets of a color (the majority of that color), they win that color.  
  When a player wins four colors (the majority of the colors), they win the game.
